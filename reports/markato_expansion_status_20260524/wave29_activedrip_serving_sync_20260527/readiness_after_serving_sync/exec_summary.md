## Notes

- DB Serving Ready is stricter than KB presence. Seller-only or limited evidence is not counted as high-quality pass.
- Commerce dry-run used the same catalog serving document builder with `includeNonPublic=false` and market-filtered source rows derived from `external_product_seeds`; no DB/index writes were attempted.
- A row can have high-quality KB and still fail DB serving readiness if identity or commerce doc hydration does not expose it.
- External index publication is tracked separately and is not a blocker for the current DB-backed serving path.
- Next remediation should start from `gap_backlog.csv` ordered by lane and domain impact.
